        "desc": "A $600,000 grant awarded to Southern University to develop sustainable menstrual products has been abruptly revoked after officials misrepresented it as transgender-focused research. The project aimed to replace synthetic hygiene items with natural fibres like regenerative cotton and support local farmers in Louisiana. But a single line in the application mentioning transgender men was weaponised by Trump’s cost-cutting agency DOGE, led by Elon Musk. The fallout has endangered researchers, ignited backlash, and fuelled fears about the politicisation of science and women's health.",
